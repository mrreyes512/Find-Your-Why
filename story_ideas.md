# Story Ideas for Partner Discovery

The **WHY** is an origin story. By looking at our past we can identify patterns. To uncover our **WHY** we must examine our standout memories / defining moments and identify connections. Discovering your **WHY** is like panning for gold in a river of the past: The gold is there, lost in the debris of the river, hidden by rushing water. Only when you take time to pan for the significant moments of the past, will they turn into a treasure.
