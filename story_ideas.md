# Story Ideas for Partner Discovery

The **WHY** is an origin story. By looking at our past we can identify patterns. To uncover our **WHY** we must examine our standout memories / defining moments and identify connections. Discovering your **WHY** is like panning for gold in a river of the past: The gold is there, lost in the debris of the river, hidden by rushing water. Only when you take time to pan for the significant moments of the past, will they turn into a treasure.

## My Personal stories

These are stories based on a timeline that have shaped my carrier and life

### Choosing a higher-level class in my Senior year in High School
Normally people pick easier classes their SR year, i went against the grain w/ Statistics. This introduced me to Sandra...

### Watching 9/11
This was a deciding factor to join the military. I knew I had to serve my country... didn't want to be involved with direct confrontation of enemy, but wanted to contribute my part.

### Going against the grain
In my Senior year, I chose to push myself in harder situations rather than going with the grain.
Examples include:
  * Working out and powerlifting competitions
  * not going out with people known for 'bad habits'
  * Triathlon competitions

### Biking from Anderson Mill to San Marcos
Plotted a challenging course from my house to Sandra's college. This did not succeed, but I learned how far I could push myself.

### Taking a leap into Navy
This felt like a leap of faith and jumping into the unknown.
It was more of a following my gut-instinct.

### Leading ESWS certification
Establishing an ESWS cert as one of the most JR ranks on our ship.
Setting the example by my actions. "do as i show, not as i say"

### Taking lead on multiple fire-teams for damage control teams
Studies for nozzleman on shipboard fires and helo-bound fires.
Got to show Sandra SCBA outfits

### Building a relationship on communication
Maintained a dedicated **four year** relationship with Sandra.

### Leaving the military
It seemed to be an easy choice, Sandra helped to influence
Another leap of faith, that there was unknown on what to do or where to go next

### Conversation with Ed Burk
This was the conversation that led me to looking into Cisco certifications
It happened after an accident in work when rear-ending a truck.

### Night Classes with ACC
This is the year that my supervisor(Michael Benivedez) was able to work with me so that I was able to take Cisco Networking Academy to pass my CCNA

### Passing my CCNA
This is when it took me 3 tries to pass my CCNA exam, it proved that not giving up worked...

### Migrating from Field Technician to NOC Analyst
This was a BIG jump from installing layer 1 to troubleshooting Layer 2, Layer 3 issues in a Network Operations Center.

### Inspiring Sandra to change carriers
I was able to inspire Sandra to shift carriers from Health Care Coding to project mgmt of Graphical Designers
Seeing her work in field that she enjoyed made me happy
