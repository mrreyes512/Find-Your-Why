# Find Your Why - Notes and Homework

All businesses, organizations, and careers operate on three levels: (1) **WHAT** we do, (2) **HOW** we do it, and (3) **WHY** we do it.

We’re all acquainted with **WHAT** we do—the products we sell, the services we offer, the jobs we do. A few of us know **HOW** we do it—the things we think differentiate us or make us unique compared to the rest of the crowd, or our competition. But only a handful of us can clearly articulate `WHY` we do what we do...

Our `WHY` is the purpose, the cause, or the belief that drives every organization and every person’s individual career.

* WHY does your company exist?
* WHY did you get out of bed this morning?
* And WHY should anyone care?

Your `WHY` is what sets you apart from everyone else. It’s your purpose. It’s what inspires you to take action. Your `WHY` is also what inspires others to take action, spread your ideas, or buy your products.

After reading this Simon Sinek's **[Find Your Why](https://www.amazon.com/Find-Your-Why-Practical-Discovering/dp/0143111728)**, it left me motivated to **discover my `WHY`**. This repo is a collection of my notes and homework that I used to help discover my `WHY`.
