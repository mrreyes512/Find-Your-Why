# Why Statement draft

Ultimately you want to come up with a statement that illustrates two major pieces: **Contribution** and **Impact**

    "TO _ _ _ _ SO THAT _ _ _ _ "

The first blank represents your contribution â€” the contribution you make to the lives others through your **WHY**. And the second blank represents the impact of your contribution.

Your job is to plug-in the blanks to create your own unique WHY Statement.
