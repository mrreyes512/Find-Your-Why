# Why Statement draft

Ultimately you want to come up with a statement that illustrates two major pieces: **Contribution** and **Impact**

    "TO _ _ _ _ SO THAT _ _ _ _ "

The first blank represents your contribution â€” the contribution you make to the lives others through your **WHY**. And the second blank represents the impact of your contribution.

Your job is to plug-in the blanks to create your own unique WHY Statement.

## My WHY Statement Discovery

Threads from my user stories as told by Steven

### My Contributions

* Push others
* **Inspire individuals with unknown potential**
* Build potential
* Lead by example
* Take one for the team

### The Impact

* Develop new tools
* Bloom beyond expectations
* **Capitalize and flourish beyond their imagine**

### My WHY Statement

"~**TO** uncover individual's unknown potential **SO THAT** They are able to do achieve their unimaginable.~"

* too many words starting with 'un'

"~**TO** inspire individual's unknown potential **SO THAT** They are able to do achieve their unimaginable.~"    
"~**TO** reveal an individual's unknown potential **SO THAT** they are able to achieve their extraordinary.~"

* feels like it focused on a single individual, rather than a group setting

"**TO** discover unknown potential in others **SO THAT** together, we are able to achieve the extraordinary"

* This feels like more of an individual / group statement.
